1. function searchInsertPosition($numbers, $target) {: This line defines a function named searchInsertPosition that takes two parameters: an array $nums and a target number $target.

2. sort($numbers);: This line sorts the array $numbers in ascending order. Sorting is necessary for the binary search algorithm to work properly.

3. $low = 0; and $high = count($numbers) - 1;: These lines initialize two variables, $low and $high, which represent the lowest and highest indexes of the array respectively. $low is set to 0, the index of the first element, and $high is set to the total number of elements in the array minus 1, as array indexing starts from 0.

4. while ($low <= $high) {: This line starts a loop that continues as long as the value of $low is less than or equal to the value of $high. This loop implements the binary search algorithm.

5. $mid = (int)(($low + $high) / 2);: This line calculates the middle index of the array. It adds the values of $low and $high, divides the sum by 2 to find the midpoint, and casts the result to an integer using (int). This is where the binary search divides the search space in half at each iteration.

6. if ($numbers[$mid] == $target) {: This line checks if the element at the middle index of the array $nums is equal to the target number $target. If it is, the function returns the index of that element.

7. elseif ($numbers[$mid] < $target) {: This line checks if the element at the middle index of the array is less than the target number. If it is, it means that the target might be located in the right half of the array.

8. $low = $mid + 1;: If the target is in the right half of the array, this line updates the value of $low to $mid + 1, effectively narrowing down the search space to the right half of the array.

9. else {: This line handles the case where the element at the middle index of the array is greater than the target number. In this case, the target might be located in the left half of the array.

10. $high = $mid - 1;: If the target is in the left half of the array, this line updates the value of $high to $mid - 1, effectively narrowing down the search space to the left half of the array.

11. return $low;: This line is reached if the target number is not found in the array. It returns the value of $low, which represents the index where the target would be inserted in order to maintain the sorted order of the array.

Example usage: These lines demonstrate how to use the searchInsertPosition function. It creates an array $numbers with elements [6, 3, 5, 1,7] and sets the target number $target to 9. Then it calls the searchInsertPosition function with these parameters and echoes the result.
